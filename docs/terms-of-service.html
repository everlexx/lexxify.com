			<h2>1.</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Lexxify Hub, which is provided by Lexxify Inc. in the United States of America.</p>
			<p>
				You are reading the terms of service (the “Terms”), which govern the relationship and serve as an
				agreement between you and us and set forth the terms and conditions by which you may access and use
				Lexxify platforms and our related websites, services, applications, products and content
				(collectively, the “Services”). Access to certain Services or features of the Services may be subject
				to age restrictions and not available to all users of the Services. Our Services are provided for
				private, non-commercial use.

				The Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and us. Please take the time to read them
				carefully. If you are under age 18, you may only use the Services with the consent of your parent or
				legal guardian. Please be sure your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and discussed these Terms
				with you.
			</p>
			<p>
				ARBITRATION NOTICE FOR USERS IN THE UNITED STATES: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A
				WAIVER OF RIGHTS TO BRING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN
				THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND Lexxify AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY
				BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND Lexxify WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR
				CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

				authorized representative of the business or entity with the authority to bind the entity to these
				Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf, and (c) your business or entity is

				Services, if we combine multiple apps or link services operated by us or our affiliates into a single
				combined service or app, or when there are regulatory changes. We will use commercially reasonable
				efforts as possible to generally notify all users of any material changes to these Terms, such as
				through a notice on our Platform, however, you should look at the Terms regularly to check for such
				changes. We will also update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms, which reflect the
				effective date of such Terms. Your continued access or use of the Services after the date of the new
				Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, please stop
				accessing or using the Services.

			<p>

				and use of the Services, you agree to the terms of the Copyright Policy.

			<p>

				illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos,
				music on and “look and feel” of the Services, and all intellectual property rights related thereto
				(the “Lexxify Content”), are either owned or licensed by Lexxify, it being understood that you or your
				licensors will own any User Content (as defined below) you upload or transmit through the Services.
				Use of the Lexxify Content or materials on the Services for any purpose not expressly permitted by
				these Terms is strictly prohibited. Such content may not be downloaded, copied, reproduced,
				distributed, transmitted, broadcast, displayed, sold, licensed or otherwise exploited for any purpose
				whatsoever without our or, where applicable, our licensors’ prior written consent. We and our
				licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted in and to their content.
			</p>
			<p>
				You acknowledge and agree that we may generate revenues, increase goodwill or otherwise increase our
				value from your use of the Services, including, by way of example and not limitation, through the sale
				of advertising, sponsorships, promotions, usage data and Gifts (defined below), and except as
				specifically permitted by us in these Terms or in another agreement you enter into with us, you will
				have no right to share in any such revenue, goodwill or value whatsoever. You further acknowledge
				that, except as specifically permitted by us in these Terms or in another agreement you enter into
				with us, you (i) have no right to receive any income or other consideration from any User Content
				(defined below) or your use of any musical works, sound recordings or audiovisual clips made available
				to you on or through the Services, including in any User Content created by you, and (ii) are
				prohibited from exercising any rights to monetize or obtain consideration from any User Content within
				the Services or on any third party service ( e.g. , you cannot claim User Content that has been
				uploaded to a social media platform such as YouTube for monetization).
			</p>
			<p>
				Subject to the terms and conditions of the Terms, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited,
				non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, worldwide license to access and use the Services,
				including to download the Platform on a permitted device, and to access the Lexxify Content solely for
				your personal, non-commercial use through your use of the Services and solely in compliance with these
				Terms. Lexxify reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Services and the Lexxify
				Content. You acknowledge and agree that Lexxify may terminate this license at any time for any reason
				or no reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				NO RIGHTS ARE LICENSED WITH RESPECT TO SOUND RECORDINGS AND THE MUSICAL WORKS EMBODIED THEREIN THAT
				ARE MADE AVAILABLE FROM OR THROUGH THE SERVICE.
			</p>
			<p>
				You acknowledge and agree that when you view content provided by others on the Services, you are doing
				so at your own risk. The content on our Services is provided for general information only. It is not
				intended to amount to advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or specialist
				advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of the content on our Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				We make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that any Lexxify
				Content (including User Content) is accurate, complete or up to date. Where our Services contain links
				to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your information
				only. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources. Such links should not be
				interpreted as approval by us of those linked websites or information you may obtain from them. You
				acknowledge that we have no obligation to pre-screen, monitor, review, or edit any content posted by
				you and other users on the Services (including User Content).
			</p>
			<p>
				User-Generated Content<br />Users of the Services may be permitted to upload, post or transmit (such
				as via a stream) or otherwise make available content through the Services including, without
				limitation, any text, photographs, user videos, sound recordings and the musical works embodied
				therein, including videos that incorporate locally stored sound recordings from your personal music
				library and ambient noise (“User Content”). Users of the Services may also extract all or any portion
				of User Content created by another user to produce additional User Content, including collaborative
				User Content with other users, that combine and intersperse User Content generated by more than one
				user. Users of the Services may also overlay music, graphics, stickers, Virtual Items (as defined and
				further explained Virtual Items Policy) and other elements provided by Lexxify (“Lexxify Elements”)
				onto this User Content and transmit this User Content through the Services. The information and
				materials in the User Content, including User Content that includes Lexxify Elements, have not been
				verified or approved by us. The views expressed by other users on the Services (including through use
				of the virtual gifts) do not represent our views or values.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whenever you access or use a feature that allows you to upload or transmit User Content through the
				Services (including via certain third party social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook,
				YouTube, Twitter), or to make contact with other users of the Services, you must comply with the
				standards set out at “Your Access to and Use of Our Services” above. You may also choose to upload or
				transmit your User Content, including User Content that includes Lexxify Elements, on sites or
				platforms hosted by third parties. If you decide to do this, you must comply with their content
				guidelines as well as with the standards set out at “Your Access to and Use of Our Services” above. As
				noted above, these features may not be available to all users of the Services, and we have no
				liability to you for limiting your right to certain features of the Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				You warrant that any such contribution does comply with those standards, and you will be liable to us
				and indemnify us for any breach of that warranty. This means you will be responsible for any loss or
				damage we suffer as a result of your breach of warranty.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any User Content will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. You must not post any User
				Content on or through the Services or transmit to us any User Content that you consider to be
				confidential or proprietary. When you submit User Content through the Services, you agree and
				represent that you own that User Content, or you have received all necessary permissions, clearances
				from, or are authorized by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Services, to
				transmit it from the Services to other third party platforms, and/or adopt any third party content.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works
				embodied in such sound recordings, then you must not post such sound recordings to the Services unless
				you have all permissions, clearances from, or are authorized by, the owner of any part of the content
				to submit it to the Services
			</p>
			<p>
				You or the owner of your User Content still own the copyright in User Content sent to us, but by
				submitting User Content via the Services, you hereby grant us an unconditional irrevocable,
				non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully transferable, perpetual worldwide license to use, modify, adapt,
				reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit, and/or distribute and to authorise other
				users of the Services and other third-parties to view, access, use, download, modify, adapt,
				reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit your User Content in any format and on
				any platform, either now known or hereinafter invented.
			</p>
			<p>
				You further grant us a royalty-free license to use your user name, image, voice, and likeness to
				identify you as the source of any of your User Content; provided, however, that your ability to
				provide an image, voice, and likeness may be subject to limitations due to age restrictions.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted in the preceding paragraphs of this Section include,
				but are not limited to, the right to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of
				the musical works embodied in such sound recordings), and publicly perform and communicate to the
				public sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), all on a royalty-free basis. This
				means that you are granting us the right to use your User Content without the obligation to pay
				royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g.,
				a record label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a performing rights
				organization (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.) (a “PRO”), a sound recording PRO (e.g., SoundExchange),
				any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers or other royalty participants involved in the creation
				of User Content.
			</p>
			<p>
				Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists. If you are a composer or author of a
				musical work and are affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free license
				you grant through these Terms in your User Content to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your
				compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music
				publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free
				license(s) set forth in these Terms in your User Content or have such music publisher enter into these
				Terms with us. Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have
				the right to grant us the licenses in these Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract with a
				record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services is in
				compliance with any contractual obligations you may have to your record label, including if you create
				any new recordings through the Services that may be claimed by your label.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through-To-The-Audience Rights. All of the rights you grant in your User Content in these Terms are
				provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of third party services
				will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content posted or used
				on such third party service via the Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				Waiver of Rights to User Content. By posting User Content to or through the Services, you waive any
				rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User
				Content. You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar
				nature in connection with your User Content, or any portion thereof. To the extent any moral rights
				are not transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral
				rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights that you may have in or
				with respect to any User Content you Post to or through the Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User
				Content posted or uploaded by you to our Services constitutes a violation of their intellectual
				property rights, or of their right to privacy.
			</p>
			<p>
				We, or authorized third parties, reserve the right to cut, crop, edit or refuse to publish, your
				content at our or their sole discretion. We have the right to remove, disallow, block or delete any
				posting you make on our Services if, in our opinion, your post does not comply with the content
				standards set out at “Your Access to and Use of Our Services”above. In addition, we have the right –
				but not the obligation – in our sole discretion to remove, disallow, block or delete any User Content
				(i) that we consider to violate these Terms, or (ii) in response to complaints from other users or
				third parties, with or without notice and without any liability to you. As a result, we recommend that
				you save copies of any User Content that you post to the Services on your personal device(s) in the
				event that you want to ensure that you have permanent access to copies of such User Content. We do not
				guarantee the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness or quality of any User Content, and under no
				circumstances will we be liable in any way for any User Content.
			</p>
			<p>
				You control whether your User Content is made publicly available on the Services to all other users of
				the Services or only available to people you approve. To restrict access to your User Content, you
				should select the privacy setting available within the Platform.
			</p>
			<p>
				We accept no liability in respect of any content submitted by users and published by us or by
				authorized third parties.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you wish to file a complaint about information or materials uploaded by other users, contact us at:
				https://lexxify.com/feedback.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lexxify takes reasonable measures to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material
				that we become aware of.It is Lexxify’s policy, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, to
				disable or terminate the accounts of users of the Services who repeatedly infringe copyrights or
				intellectual property rights of others.
			</p>
			<p>
				While our own staff is continually working to develop and evaluate our own product ideas and features,
				we pride ourselves on paying close attention to the interests, feedback, comments, and suggestions we
				receive from the user community. If you choose to contribute by sending us or our employees any ideas
				for products, services, features, modifications, enhancements, content, refinements, technologies,
				content offerings (such as audio, visual, games, or other types of content), promotions, strategies,
				or product/feature names, or any related documentation, artwork, computer code, diagrams, or other
				materials (collectively “Feedback”), then regardless of what your accompanying communication may say,
				the following terms will apply, so that future misunderstandings can be avoided. Accordingly, by
				sending Feedback to us, you agree that:
			</p>
			<p>
				Lexxify has no obligation to review, consider, or implement your Feedback, or to return to you all or
				part of any Feedback for any reason;
			</p>
			<p>
				Feedback is provided on a non-confidential basis, and we are not under any obligation to keep any
				Feedback you send confidential or to refrain from using or disclosing it in any way; and
			</p>
			<p>
				You irrevocably grant us perpetual and unlimited permission to reproduce, distribute, create
				derivative works of, modify, publicly perform (including on a through-to-the-audience basis),
				communicate to the public, make available, publicly display, and otherwise use and exploit the
				Feedback and derivatives thereof for any purpose and without restriction, free of charge and without
				attribution of any kind, including by making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, and
				promoting commercial products and services that incorporate or embody Feedback, whether in whole or in
				part, and whether as provided or as modified.
			</p>
			<h2>8. Indemnity</h2>
			<p>
				You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Lexxify, its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates,
				and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors from any and all
				claims, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and expenses,
				arising out of a breach by you or any user of your account of these Terms or arising out of a breach
				of your obligations, representation and warranties under these Terms.
			</p>
			<h2>9. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES</h2>
			<p>
				NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL AFFECT ANY STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT YOU CANNOT CONTRACTUALLY AGREE TO ALTER
				OR WAIVE AND ARE LEGALLY ALWAYS ENTITLED TO AS A CONSUMER.
			</p>

				THEM. IN PARTICULAR WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU THAT:
			</p>
			YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS;<br />
			YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERROR;<br />

			AND<br />

			BE CORRECTED.<br />
			<p>
				NO CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES OR OTHER TERMS (INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED TERMS AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY,
				FITNESS FOR PURPOSE OR CONFORMANCE WITH DESCRIPTION) APPLY TO THE SERVICES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT
				THEY ARE EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THE TERMS. WE MAY CHANGE, SUSPEND, WITHDRAW OR RESTRICT THE AVAILABILITY
				OF ALL OR ANY PART OF OUR PLATFORM FOR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL REASONS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE
			</p>

			<p>
				NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY
				EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THIS INCLUDES LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY
				OUR NEGLIGENCE OR THE NEGLIGENCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR SUBCONTRACTORS AND FOR FRAUD OR

			<h2>11. Other Terms</h2>
			<p>
				Open Source.The Platform contains certain open source software. Each item of open source software is
				subject to its own applicable license terms, which can be found at Open Source Policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Entire Agreement.These Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Lexxify and govern
				your use of the Services and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Lexxify in
				relation to the Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				Links. You may link to our home page, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not
				damage our reputation or take advantage of it. You must not establish a link in such a way as to
				suggest any form of association, approval or endorsement on our part where none exists. You must not
				establish a link to our Services in any website that is not owned by you. The website in which you are
				linking must comply in all respects with the content standards set out at “Your Access to and Use of
				Our Services” above. We reserve the right to withdraw linking permission without notice.
			</p>
			<p>
				No Waiver. Our failure to insist upon or enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be construed
				as a waiver of any provision or right.
			</p>
			<p>
				Security. We do not guarantee that our Services will be secure or free from bugs or viruses. You are
				responsible for configuring your information technology, computer programmes and platform to access
				our Services. You should use your own virus protection software.
			</p>
			<p>
				Severability. If any court of law, having jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
				provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without
				affecting the rest of the Terms, and the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid
				and enforceable.
			</p>
			<p>
				ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement
				that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other
				representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by
				following the opt out procedure described below.
			</p>
			<p>
				Informal Process First. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Lexxify, you will
				first contact Lexxify and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting
				to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.
			</p>
			<p>
				Arbitration Agreement. After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute,
				controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to your use of Lexxify’s services
				and/or products, including the Services, or relating in any way to the communications between you and
				Lexxify or any other user of the Services, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This
				mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Lexxify. However, this arbitration
				agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Lexxify for infringement of its intellectual property or
				access to the Services that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar
				you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an
				individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first of the
				date you access or use this Services by following the procedure described below.
			</p>
			<p>
				You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
				provision, and that you and Lexxify are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in
				a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution
				procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to:
			</p>
			<p>Email Address: <a href="mailto:contact@lexxify.com">contact@lexxify.com</a></p>
			<p>
				The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules
				including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
				If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary
				Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at
				www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
			</p>
			<p>
				Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you
				are an individual and have not accessed or used the Services on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse
				those fees for claims where the amount in dispute is less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator
				determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration
				unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
			</p>
			<p>
				The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve
				any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability,
				enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part
				of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to
				the “Class Action Waiver” section below.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Lexxify and you are an individual, you may opt out of
				this arbitration agreement by sending an email to contact@Lexxify.com within thirty (30) days of the
				first of the date you access or use the Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				Class Action Waiver. Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not
				as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff,
				or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class
				Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to
				combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or
				entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is
				unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent
				jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to
				have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is
				waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.
			</p>
			<p>
				If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration
				Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
				injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
				necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim
				proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Lexxify each waive any right to a jury trial.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a counter-notice is received by Lexxify’s Copyright Agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice
				to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed content or
				cease disabling it. Unless the original complaining party files an action seeking a court order
				against the Content Provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it
				restored, in ten business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Lexxify’s sole
				discretion.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please understand that filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the
				complaining party to determine ownership. Be aware that there may be adverse legal consequences in
				your country if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.
			</p>
			<p>
