			<h1>Lexxify and Lexxify Hub Privacy Policy</h1>

			<p>Most recently updated: June 11, 2023</p>

			<p>
				Thank you for using Lexxify Hub. Lexxify Hub is owned and operated by Lexxify Inc. We at Lexxify Inc.
				are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how
				we collect, store, use, and process information from and about users of Lexxify Hub. By using Lexxify
				Hub, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this
				Privacy Policy.<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				As with other social media platforms, during the course of your usage of our apps, products, or other
				services, our service may receive information from and about you, including information that you
				provide, information from other sources, and other automatically inferred information.
			</p>

			<h2>Information/Data You Provide</h2>

			<p>
				When you create an account, upload content, contact us directly, or otherwise use the Platform, you
				may provide some or all of the following information: account and profile information, such as name,
				age, username, password, language, email, phone number, social media account information, and profile
				image. After registering for a Lexxify account, you may access, review, and/or edit/update certain
				personal information that you have provided to Lexxify by logging into your account going to the
				Settings.<br /><br />If you select to sign-up or log-in to Lexxify Hub using a third-party service
				such as Facebook or Google, or otherwise link your Lexxify account to a third-party service, this
				process will prompt our service to access your public profile information on that platform, such as
				email and friends list.<br /><br />By letting Lexxify access your device services, the service
				automatically collects certain information from you when you use Lexxify Hub, including internet or
				other network activity information such as your IP address, geolocation-related data, unique device
				identifiers, browsing and search history (including content you have viewed in Lexxify Hub), and
				Cookies. Cookies help Lexxify collect information and analyze usage of our platform, and help us
				enhance the user experience by giving us data on how best to efficiently format the user experience.
				To disable certain Cookies, please refer to your browser settings and options. Note that having
				certain Cookies disabled may affect your ability to access the full range of Lexxify Hub functionality
				and services.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our service will collect and store any user-generated content that you post or upload to Lexxify Hub,
				such as images, audio, videos, weblinks, hashtags, and comments. This also includes any messages you
				may send to other users in the chat functionality. The service will also collect and store the
				associated metadata, such as when, where, and by whom the content was created. If you apply an
				edit/filter/effect to an image or audio or other data if applicable the service may collect and store
				a version before the respective edits/filter/effect are applied. We may collect information about the
				videos, images, and audio that are a part of your user content, such as identifying the objects and
				scenery that appear, the existence and location within an image of physical features and attributes,
				the nature of the audio, and the text of the words in audio in your post. We may collect this
				information to enable special video effects, for content moderation, to improve user experience, to
				provide recommendations for other users, for demographic analysis, for effective content and ad
				recommendations, and for other non-personally-identifying operations.
			</p>

			<p>
				When you upload or create content, you automatically upload certain metadata that is connected to that
				content. Metadata refers to other data related to the content and provides information about your
				content that will not always be viewable to users. The metadata can describe how, when, where, and by
				whom the content was created, collected, or modified, or how long the audio is or how large the data
				is.
			</p>

			<p>
				In order to provide services, we also access the information, including text, images, and videos,
				found in your device's clipboard, when you provide it to us by copying or pasting content in Lexxify
				Hub. For example, if you choose to paste content from the clipboard into Lexxify Hub, we access this
				information stored in your clipboard so that we can carry out your action on our system.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our service stores messages, which include information you provide when you compose, send, or receive
				messages through the Platform's messaging functionalities. This includes messages you send through our
				chat functionality. That information includes the content of the message and information about the
				message, such as when it was sent, received, or read, and message participants. Messages you choose to
				send to other users of Lexxify Hub will be accessible by those users and that we are not responsible
				for the manner in which those users use or share the messages.
			</p>

			<p>
				Lexxify Hub accesses your phone and social network contacts, with your permission. If you choose to
				find other users through your phone contacts, we will access and collect information such as names,
				phone numbers, and email addresses, and match that information against existing users of the Platform.
				If you choose to find other users through your social network contacts, we will collect your profile
				information that you have made accessible as well as names and profiles of your social network
				contacts.

				accesses information in correspondence you send to us, including when you contact us for support, as
				well as any information you share through surveys or your participation in challenges, research,
				promotions, marketing campaigns

				responsible if you disclose sensitive personal information on a publicly available post setting or
				other area where other users can view your information. Even if you are not a user, information about
				you may appear in content created or published by other users on Lexxify Hub if they have that
				data/information about you, just as it is possible that you may incidentally appear in photos taken by
				others while you are in public settings, or just as it is possible for other people who know you or

				responsible or able to police fair usage of this data for public domain, and any potential legal

				able to see your purchase.<br /><br />We store user data/information for as long as necessary to
				provide platform services and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also store
				information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, and for the exercise of
				legal claims.
			</p>

			<p>
				The storage periods may vary depending on different criteria, such as the type of information and the
				purposes for which the information is used; for example your profile information is stored to provide
				you with platform services, and we keep this information for as long as you have an account. If you
				violate our Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or other conditions or policies, we reserve the
				right to deactivate, delete, or otherwise remove your profile immediately, but may keep other
				information about you stored while we are deliberating your violation.
